<I><P> Five people are gathered together in an old, creaky, country house.</I><p>

<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> I would like you all to sit down please because I would like to discuss with you what I think is happening here.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex: </font color="#0000FF">Well that would be a relief.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane:</font color="#0000FF"> I am frightened. I want out of here.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF">I may not be able to help with that but hopefully I can give you an explanation. I am not sure you will be very pleased with it though. I want to ask you some questions but first We are going to talk once more about the wine glass.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael: </font color="#0000FF">Oh no!<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> Oh yes, I am afraid as it is more important that you appreciate.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane: </font color="#0000FF">Well I am glad there is someone that doesn't think I am crazy.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF">And also the whiskey glass?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane:</font color="#0000FF"> Oh you know about that? You were upstairs when we discussed it.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF">Yes I was, but still I know about it.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel:</font color="#0000FF"> That's a bit weird<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex:</font color="#0000FF"> Everything seems a bit weird if you ask me.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes it really does.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael:</font color="#0000FF"> And getting weirder by the minute I think.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> Prepare yourself sir for what you will probably find even weirder.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane:</font color="#0000FF"> Is that possible.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> If my suspicions are right, definitely. Jane, you first noticed the oddity with the wine glass, what were your thoughts about that?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane: </font color="#0000FF">Seems silly really but I kind of felt someone was playing about with us, trying to confuse us. <p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF">I see.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane: </font color="#0000FF">I even thought it might be you.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> No, it was definitely not me. So has anybody else noticed anything odd about this situation?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel:</font color="#0000FF"> What do you mean odd?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF">Just anything that may seem unusual?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex:</font color="#0000FF"> I can't say that I have.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector. </font color="#0000FF">You may remember before I did the search that some of you seemed to think I was being very slow and not really doing my job.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael:</font color="#0000FF"> I didn't mean to be rude but it did seem that way.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> I was observing. Observing and thinking.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael:</font color="#0000FF"> Ok that's fair enough, and what did you observe?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF">Similar observations to those made by Jane. She seems to be the only one that has actually questioned seriously what is going on.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel:</font color="#0000FF"> So what is going on inspector?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> I asked you all if you had noticed anything unusual. Apart from Jane, none of you had.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex:</font color="#0000FF"> That's true.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF">What about the lights?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael: </font color="#0000FF">What lights?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF">The room lights Michael.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael: </font color="#0000FF">There are no room lights inspector.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> Exactly. Do you not think it curious that we have been here all this time in virtual darkness?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel:</font color="#0000FF"> Oh my gosh! Yes. How come nobody noticed?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex:</font color="#0000FF"> I guess it just got dark after we arrived and we just didn't get around to putting the lights on.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF">That is one explanation of course.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel: </font color="#0000FF">No. No, it isn't. It has been dark all the time we have been here.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane:</font color="#0000FF"> This is getting weirder and weirder. I thought somebody was messing with us now it looks like we are messing with ourselves.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> Would you say it appears that we are a little like a jigsaw puzzle? The pieces are there but not quite fit together yet?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane: </font color="#0000FF">Yes! That is a good description, that is exactly how it feels.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Murial: </font color="#0000FF">This is really frightening, what on Earth is happening?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF">Let me ask you all something else?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel: </font color="#0000FF">Is this going to be even more frightening?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> Even if it is, I cannot see how to avoid it, if we want the truth<p>.
<font color="#0000FF">Alex: </font color="#0000FF">I definitely want the truth.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector.</font color="#0000FF"> Very well then. Who called me?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane:</font color="#0000FF"> What do you mean?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> I am here to investigative a murder, it seems..... Lets assume I was not just walking about knocking on doors saying any murders here. Somebody must have called me. Called the police. So who did that?<p>
(there is a moments silence)<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane:</font color="#0000FF"> I didn't call.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel: </font color="#0000FF">Nor did I<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael: </font color="#0000FF">Who the heck did then, because I didn't.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF">You see, one more thing that you didn't observe.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel: </font color="#0000FF">I am glad I am sitting down. My knees feel weak.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex: </font color="#0000FF">I must say Inspector, you are really beginning to shock me.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael: </font color="#0000FF">Me too. I am utterly, utterly confused now.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF">It is giving me no pleasure to confuse you but I did want to give you some answers.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane:</font color="#0000FF"> I don't feel we have any answers yet.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> Possibly not.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex: </font color="#0000FF">I would definitely like some.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> Michael, you seemed a little confused about the glass of whisky. So let me ask you something.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael: </font color="#0000FF">Ok.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> How did you arrive here?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael: </font color="#0000FF">What do you mean?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> A simple question. How did you get here? Bus? Train? Did you drive?<p>
(there is a short silence)<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael:</font color="#0000FF"> Oh dear! This is really crazy, I don't know.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> The answer I expected. Do any of you know?<p>
(another short silence)<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane:</font color="#0000FF"> I feel really, very frightened now.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel:</font color="#0000FF"> Me too and have this feeling that we should never have questioned anything. I feel we have broken some sort of rule.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes Moo it feels exactly like that.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF">You feel we have opened Pandora's box?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex:</font color="#0000FF"> Just a minute. Don't you think it is strange that you have a notion about Pandora's box but Michael cannot remember how he arrived here, and for that matter nor do I.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes I agree that is very strange.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel: </font color="#0000FF">Have we been hypnotised inspector?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane: </font color="#0000FF">That would be a likely explanation.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex:</font color="#0000FF"> Or have we all been drugged to give us memory loss? You know when people have memory loss some things they remember but some things they don't?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes! That could be it.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael:</font color="#0000FF"> But who would want to drug us? And why?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex:</font color="#0000FF"> We wouldn't know would we, because we wouldn't be able to remember.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel:</font color="#0000FF"> So what has this got to do with murder, and murder weapons?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane:</font color="#0000FF"> Is someone drugging us so that we will commit murder?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael:</font color="#0000FF"> How abut you Inspector? You have no idea either how you got here so what is your explanation?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF">I do have it in my head that I should solve a murder but as we all know, there hasn't been one.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel: </font color="#0000FF">So if it is only us here and there is a murder, none of us actually know if we are the murderer or the victim.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex:</font color="#0000FF"> And I guess you have no idea either Inspector?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> No. I am afraid at this stage, I don't.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane:</font color="#0000FF"> So why don't we just leave. Walk out. Then we can't be murdered or be the murderer?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF">I have not tried it but something tells me that would not be possible.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex:</font color="#0000FF"> Why not?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> Just a feeling I have.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael:</font color="#0000FF"> Only on way to find out, let's try the door.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex:</font color="#0000FF"> Good idea.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael.</font color="#0000FF"> (pause) The inspector is right. It's locked or jammed or something.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane: </font color="#0000FF">How about the window let me try.<p>
<font color="#0000FF"> Muriel:</font color="#0000FF"> I 'll help<p>
(there is a bit of grunting)<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane:</font color="#0000FF"> No, this is stuck too, it won't shift<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel: </font color="#0000FF">Jane, Jane. Look out of the window<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane: </font color="#0000FF">What? There is nothing there.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel:</font color="#0000FF"> Exactly. Nothing, nothing at all. No street lights, no buildings, nothing. Just blank.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane: </font color="#0000FF">This is so very, very scary<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel:</font color="#0000FF"></font color="#0000FF"> Yes I am very frightened now. How will we get out?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex: </font color="#0000FF">It really does seem like we can't<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael:</font color="#0000FF"> We also seem to have no idea where we actually are<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel:</font color="#0000FF"> Inspector, please, what is happening?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane:</font color="#0000FF"> Are we ever going to get out?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF">I am almost as foxed as you are.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex:</font color="#0000FF"> What do you mean? Almost?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> I have some idea but the answer is almost as frightening as the question.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane: </font color="#0000FF">Whatever it is I want to know.<p>
 <font color="#0000FF">Michael:</font color="#0000FF"> We all do.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> </font color="#0000FF">If I explain, I feel you my not believe me anyway.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex:</font color="#0000FF"> Tell us though. I want to know, whatever it is.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael:</font color="#0000FF"> Me too.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF">Lets look at the evidence – such as it is.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael:</font color="#0000FF"> That's a start.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF">Nothing makes any real sense does it?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael: </font color="#0000FF">That's true enough.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane: </font color="#0000FF">I hate to say it but yes, the glasses thing.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF">Exactly. That made no sense at all.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex: </font color="#0000FF">I will admit that now.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> Good, that's a start.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael:</font color="#0000FF"> Me too, you were right Jane, it was very odd.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> Then of course there are the murder weapons.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes, why four of them?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF">That is what I couldn't understand. There seemed no point or reason to have four of them. Unless...<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex:</font color="#0000FF"> Unless what inspector?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> Unless there were going to be four separate murders.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane: </font color="#0000FF">Which I suppose seems unlikely.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF">And the most confusing thing of course, none of us actually remembers how we got here.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel: </font color="#0000FF">We must have been drugged.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector.</font color="#0000FF"> No, I don't think so.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex:</font color="#0000FF"> It does seem a feasible explanation.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF">Maybe, but I think it is far more sinister than that.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane:</font color="#0000FF"> Oh my goodness.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> And of course I was here to investigate a murder, but none of you actually called the police.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane: </font color="#0000FF">That is true and I should tell you that there is something else I just noticed. There is no telephone.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> I also noticed that.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael: </font color="#0000FF">That is not so much a mystery, hardly anyone uses a house phone now. People just use cell phones.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF">Do you have one Michael?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael: </font color="#0000FF">Yes, here in my jacket.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF">Suppose I asked you to call one of your friends. Who would you call?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael: </font color="#0000FF">Well, I'd probably call ( a short silence) I... I don't know. This is so ridiculous. I cannot remember the name of even one of my friends.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> I thought that may be the case actually.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex:</font color="#0000FF">This is so crazy. What on Earth is happening?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> Check your phone Michael, make a call, any call.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael:</font color="#0000FF"> Ok, and of course I will have a list of my friends on it. I can call one. Maybe someone can get us out.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF">Try it.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael:</font color="#0000FF"> (after another short pause) It's not working?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex: </font color="#0000FF">Not at all?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael:</font color="#0000FF"> No. I mean it is more than not working. It's like one of those dummy phones that you get in phone retailers. Completely dead!<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF">If anyone else has a cell phone you can try it but I think you will find it the same.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex:</font color="#0000FF"> I just did. And it is the same.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF">So one more thing that does not make sense.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael:</font color="#0000FF"> And the doors and windows. All blocked.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF">Precisely.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex:</font color="#0000FF"> It does seem like we are imprisoned<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes it does.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> However, I don't think we are. Not as such.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex:</font color="#0000FF"> Then what?<p>
<font color="#0000FF"> Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> At the risk of making this even more confusing, may I ask you a few more questions?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael: </font color="#0000FF">I am past trying to make any sense of this now so go ahead.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF">We saw that Michael cannot remember the name of one friend. Can anyone (a short silence) I thought so. Jane, what is your Job?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane:</font color="#0000FF"> Oh I can answer that I am a nurse.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> Good. Where?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane: </font color="#0000FF">In a hospital of course.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF">Which one. What is its name?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane:</font color="#0000FF"> (almost sobbing) I don't know.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> And I have no idea of the name of the police station that I am from. I would assume we all have little notion of what we do or where we do it.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel:</font color="#0000FF"> (loudly) The lights! The lights are back on<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex:</font color="#0000FF"> How? How on Earth did that happen?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael:</font color="#0000FF"> How did that happen? Nobody moved.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> (exasperated)That is it!<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane: </font color="#0000FF">What inspector? What is it?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> It is the final piece of evidence<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel: </font color="#0000FF">What evidence inspector?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> The light. It has confirmed my suspicions. This is going to be such a huge shock to you all.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane: </font color="#0000FF">Tell us what is it?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF">We don't exist. None of us.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane, Alex, Muriel, Michael:</font color="#0000FF">(Together) WHAT!!<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> Believe me, we do not actually exist.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael: </font color="#0000FF">What are you talking about, of course we exist, we can all see each other.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> Only on paper.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex:</font color="#0000FF"> what do you mean? Only on paper?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF">Exactly that. Its why we felt we were a little like a jigsaw puzzle being put together.<p>
<font color="#0000FF"> Jane:</font color="#0000FF"> I still don't understand.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF">On paper. We only exist on paper.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel: </font color="#0000FF">What paper?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF">We are just characters.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex: </font color="#0000FF">Characters?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF">Yes! Only that. It is why we have no memory. We have no memory because we have no real life. We only have a meomry that has been given to us. And the confusion with the murder weapons and glasses is because there is no definite story yet.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel: </font color="#0000FF">I don't understand. What do you mean.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> Why do you think the light just came on?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel:</font color="#0000FF"> I have no idea.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF">It was the writer.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael: </font color="#0000FF">The writer?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes the writer. He just came back into the room and turned on the light. We are not real. We are just characters in a story. He came back to write more. ( wistfully and slowly)Now we will know who the murderer is and who will get murdered!!!<p>
